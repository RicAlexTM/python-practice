for qsn1:
a) I created a list of integers and introduced a for loop that added each of the numbers in the list
b) I created a list of strings and introduced a for loop that concatenated them to one string

for qsn2:
I allowed the user to input a number and through the modulus operator, check whether the number is even or odd ie if there is remainder when the number is divided by 2

for qsn3:
I allowed an input for a number whose factorial was to be found and used a for loop to find the factorial of the number ie when the number is zero automatically the factorial is 1 other wise the factorial is given my multiplying i to the previous value of the factorial until it loops to the original number

for qsn4:
√ç introduced a for loop to loop through letters of a given word and added the letters to the reversed string before the reversed string resulting to the reverse of the given word

for qsn 5:
I introduced a recursive function factorial() with a base case where if the number is 0 its factorial is 1 and a  recursive case that loops till the base case where the factorial of 0 is defined

for qsn 6: 
I converted number to a string to allow the programme to loop through the digits adding each of them
